# Online-Voting-System
The project outlined is a simple implementation of an Online Voting System using Python and Flask, a web framework. Here's an overview:

**Objective:**
The goal of this project is to provide a basic online platform for users to vote for candidates and view the voting results.

**Components:**
1. **Flask Web Application (`app.py`):**
   - This is the core of the project. It handles the routing, user interactions, and database operations.
   - It defines three routes: 
     - `'/'`: Renders a page for users to vote.
     - `'/vote'`: Handles the form submission when a user casts a vote.
     - `'/results'`: Displays the voting results.

2. **SQLite Database (`database.db`):**
   - SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database system used to store vote data.
   - In this project, it's used to keep track of the votes and candidates.

3. **HTML Templates (in the `templates` folder):**
   - These templates define the structure and appearance of the web pages.
   - `index.html`: This is the page where users can cast their votes. It contains a form with radio buttons for candidate selection.
   - `results.html`: This page displays the voting results, showing the number of votes each candidate received.

**How It Works:**
1. When a user accesses the web application, they are directed to the `'/'` route, which renders the `index.html` template.
2. Users can select a candidate and submit their vote through the form on the `index.html` page.
3. The form submission triggers a POST request to the `'/vote'` route in the Flask application.
4. The `vote()` function in `app.py` handles this request. It extracts the selected candidate and inserts it into the SQLite database.
5. After a successful vote submission, the user is redirected back to the `'/'` route (i.e., the voting page).
6. Users can also navigate to the `'/results'` route to view the voting results. The `results()` function retrieves and displays the data from the database.

**Running the Project:**
- To run the project, you would execute the `app.py` file. This starts the Flask web application, and you can access it in a web browser.

**Important Notes:**
- This is a simplified example for learning purposes. In a real-world scenario, an online voting system would require extensive security measures, user authentication, encryption, and other considerations to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the votes.
- Additionally, the system described here lacks user management, so it doesn't prevent a user from voting multiple times.

Remember, if you plan to deploy a voting system in a real-world scenario, you'll need to consider many more factors, including security, scalability, and compliance with legal and ethical standards.
